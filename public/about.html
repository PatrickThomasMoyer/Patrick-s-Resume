<h1>Hobbies and More About Me</h1>
<p>Writing, reading, watching movies and documentaries, and golfing
    are some of my favorite hobbies. My wife and I spend a lot of time
    visiting our favorite spots around central Florida like Winter Garden, Downtown Clermont,
    and Universal Studios in our spare time. We roadtrip around the sate and up
    the east coast as much as possible.</p>

<p>I'm finishing up my second novel, building a home office and new laundry room in our house,
    and learning to code so I can bring in a second source of income.</p>
